# Network Basics Project üì°üíª

Welcome to the **Network Basics Project**! This project will guide you through fundamental networking concepts and practical Bash scripting tasks to deepen your understanding of how networks operate.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project covers essential networking topics including:

- The **OSI Model** and its 7 layers
- Different types of networks: **LAN**, **WAN**, and the **Internet**
- Understanding **MAC** and **IP addresses**
- The difference between **TCP** and **UDP** protocols
- Common **TCP/UDP ports** and their uses
- Using **ping** and **ICMP** to check network connectivity

You will also write Bash scripts to practice these concepts on Ubuntu 22.04.

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to confidently explain:

- What the **OSI model** is and how it is organized
- What a **LAN** and **WAN** are, including their typical usage and geographical size
- What the **Internet** is
- What an **IP address** is and the difference between **private** and **public** IPs
- What **localhost** means
- What a **subnet** is
- Why **IPv6** was created
- The two main data transfer protocols for IP: **TCP** and **UDP**
- The main differences between **TCP** and **UDP**
- What a **port** is and memorize ports for **SSH (22)**, **HTTP (80)**, and **HTTPS (443)**
- How to use **ping** to check if a host is reachable on the network

## üìù Project Requirements

- All scripts must be written in **Bash** and executable
- Use only allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- Scripts must run on **Ubuntu 22.04**
- All scripts must pass **shellcheck** with no errors
- Each script must start with:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder
